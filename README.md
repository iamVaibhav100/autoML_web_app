# AutoML Web App

Built using the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) framework.

This a web application that allows the user to upload a dataset and train a machine learning model.
User can test the model on new data and can tweak the hyperparameters of the model and retrain it.

Application is still under development. New models and features will be added in the future.
